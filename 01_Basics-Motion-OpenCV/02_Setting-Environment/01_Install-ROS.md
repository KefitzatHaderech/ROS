# Installing ROS Noetic on Ubuntu 20.04**

In this comprehensive tutorial, we will guide you through the process of installing ROS Noetic on Ubuntu 20.04, setting up your workspace, cloning the Discourse Hub repository compatible with ROS Noetic, and finally executing sample code in both C++ and Python. This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of Linux and terminal commands.

**1. Installing ROS Noetic:**

- Open your web browser and navigate to the ROS Noetic installation page. You can find it by searching "ROS Noetic installation".
- On the installation page, you will find different options for ROS distributions. Since we're installing ROS Noetic on Ubuntu 20.04, choose the appropriate link for Ubuntu.
- Follow the installation instructions provided on the ROS Noetic installation page. This typically involves setting up the software sources, importing the ROS keyring, and finally installing ROS Noetic using Debian packages.
- The installation process will take some time. Once completed, you need to set up the environment by sourcing the setup file. This can be done by running the following command in the terminal:

  ```
  source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
  ```
- Optionally, you can add the above command to your bashrc file to automatically source it every time you open a new terminal window. This ensures that ROS environment variables are set correctly.
- To verify that ROS Noetic has been installed successfully, you can run the following command in the terminal:

  ```
  roscore
  ```
- If ROS is installed correctly, you should see the ROS Master node starting up without any errors.

**2. Setting up your workspace:**

- Once ROS Noetic is installed, it's time to set up your workspace. Create a new directory for your workspace using the following command:

  ```
  mkdir -p ~/ros_workspace/src
  ```
- Navigate to your workspace directory:

  ```
  cd ~/ros_workspace
  ```
- Now, initialize your workspace using the following command:

  ```
  catkin_init_workspace
  ```
- Your workspace is now set up and ready for use.

**3. Cloning the Discourse Hub repository:**

- Clone the Discourse Hub repository from GitHub into your workspace's source directory:

  ```
  cd ~/ros_workspace/src
  git clone <Discourse_Hub_Repository_URL>
  ```
- Replace `<Discourse_Hub_Repository_URL>` with the actual URL of the Discourse Hub repository.

**4. Compiling the project:**

- Navigate back to your workspace directory:

  ```
  cd ~/ros_workspace
  ```
- Build the packages in your workspace using Catkin:

  ```
  catkin_make
  ```
- This command will compile all the packages in your workspace, including the Discourse Hub repository.

**5. Executing sample code in C++ and Python:**

- Now that the project is compiled, you can execute the sample code provided in both C++ and Python.
- Navigate to the directory containing the sample code:

  ```
  cd ~/ros_workspace/src/<Discourse_Hub_Repository>/sample_code
  ```
