# Setting Up ROS Essentials CPP Package

Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on setting up the ROS Essentials CPP package. Throughout this course, you'll be provided with various demos and examples to enhance your understanding of ROS (Robot Operating System). To ensure seamless access to all the necessary code, I'll guide you through the process of downloading and setting up the ROS Essentials CPP package from GitHub.

## Step 1: Accessing GitHub Repository

1. Navigate to the Catkin workspace directory on your system.
2. Open the `src` folder within the Catkin workspace.
3. Visit the GitHub repository containing the ROS Essentials CPP package. You can do this by searching for it on Google or directly visiting GitHub.
   - Repository Name: Ros Essentials CPP
   - Branches:
     - **Master:** Compatible with ROS Kinetic and ROS Melodic.
     - **Ros Noetic:** Specifically developed for ROS Noetic, the latest ROS distribution.

## Step 2: Cloning the Repository

If you're using ROS Noetic, follow these steps to clone the repository:

1. In the terminal, navigate to the `src` directory within your Catkin workspace.
2. Execute the following command to clone the repository, specifying the ROS Noetic branch:
   ```
   git clone -b master <repository_url>
   ```

   Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the GitHub repository.

## Step 3: Verifying Download

1. After cloning, verify that the ROS Essentials CPP package is now present in your Catkin workspace.
   - You can use the `ls` command to list the contents of the `src` directory.
   - Alternatively, use your file browser to navigate to the `src` folder and confirm the presence of the package.

## Step 4: Compiling the Workspace

1. Once the package is downloaded, navigate back to the Catkin workspace directory.
2. Compile the entire workspace using the `catkin_make` command:
   ```
   catkin_make
   ```

   This command will build all packages within the workspace, including the newly added ROS Essentials CPP package.
3. Monitor the compilation process for any errors. If everything is set up correctly, there should be no errors.

## Step 5: Verification (For ROS Noetic)

1. After successful compilation, verify the compilation result specifically for the ROS Essentials CPP package.
2. Ensure that the package compiled without any errors, especially on a fresh installation of ROS Noetic.
