## Introduction to ROS Versions

ROS (Robot Operating System) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It provides a wide range of tools, libraries, and conventions to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of platforms. Understanding the different versions of ROS and their evolution is crucial for developers and researchers working in the field of robotics.

In this comprehensive tutorial, we'll delve into the various versions of ROS, their features, and the evolution of usage patterns over time.

### 1. ROS Indigo: The Inception of Long-Term Support (LTS)

- **Release Year**: 2014
- **Status**: Long-Term Support (LTS)
- **Significance**: ROS Indigo marked the beginning of LTS versions, offering stability and support for an extended period.
- **Usage**: Widely adopted initially, providing a solid foundation for ROS development.

### 2. ROS Kinetic: Continuation of Long-Term Support

- **Release Year**: 2016
- **Status**: LTS
- **Significance**: ROS Kinetic continued the tradition of LTS versions, ensuring reliability and longevity for ROS projects.
- **Usage**: Remained actively used by around 50% of ROS users even beyond its initial release year.

### 3. ROS Versions without Long-Term Support

- **Examples**: ROS Jade, ROS Lunar
- **Significance**: While these versions lacked LTS status, they still contributed to the ROS ecosystem, albeit with less popularity among users.
- **Usage**: Less favored compared to LTS versions due to shorter support cycles.

### 4. Emergence of ROS Melodic

- **Release Year**: 2018
- **Significance**: ROS Melodic started gaining traction in the ROS community, particularly in the years 2019 and 2020.
- **Usage**: Witnessed increasing adoption, indicating its potential as a stable and reliable ROS version.

### 5. Transition to ROS 2

- **ROS 2 Release Year**: 2017 (with Ardent version)
- **Current ROS 2 Version**: Dashing (as of May 2020)
- **Future Outlook**: ROS 2 represents the future of ROS development, addressing various issues faced by ROS 1 users.
- **Status**: Still under development, but steadily gaining momentum.

### Understanding ROS 1 vs. ROS 2

ROS 1 and ROS 2 serve as two distinct branches of the ROS ecosystem, each with its own set of features and capabilities. Here's a brief comparison:

- **ROS 1**:
  - Established framework with a large user base.
  - Widely used in various robotics applications.
  - Limited scalability and real-time capabilities.
- **ROS 2**:
  - Next-generation ROS framework.
  - Improved scalability, real-time performance, and security.
  - Designed to address the limitations of ROS 1 and support future robotics applications.
