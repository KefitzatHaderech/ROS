# Transitioning to ROS 2

**Introduction:**

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) brings significant improvements over ROS 1, aiming to establish a more standardized and versatile communication framework between processes. This tutorial will guide you through the transition from ROS 1 to ROS 2, focusing on the key changes, advantages, and practical implementation of ROS 2 in your robotics projects.

**1. Understanding the Motivation behind ROS 2:**

- ROS 2 eliminates the need for a central node like the Roastmaster, enabling standalone processes.
- Standardized communication is facilitated through the use of the Global Data Distribution Standard (DDS).
- ROS 2 is designed to be cross-platform, supporting Linux, Windows, and macOS.
- It targets both single robot and swarm robotics scenarios, offering quality of service and real-time guarantees.

**2. Key Changes and Improvements in ROS 2:**

- **Communication Paradigm:** Transition from Roastmaster-based communication to DDS for enhanced scalability, flexibility, and real-time performance.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** ROS 2 is compatible with Linux, Windows, and macOS, broadening its applicability across different operating systems.
- **Quality of Service (QoS):** ROS 2 introduces QoS profiles, enabling priority assignment to processes based on their requirements.
- **Transition to Production:** ROS 2 facilitates the transition from prototyping to production, offering a robust framework for developing robotics applications.

**3. Middleware Selection:**

- ROS 1 had its own middleware based on ROS, TCP, and UDP, but ROS 2 opted for the more scalable and flexible DDS.
- DDS (Data Distribution Service) is an industry-standard communication system designed by the Object Management Group.
- It offers publish-subscribe mechanisms, real-time communication, and is utilized in various domains such as finance, air traffic control, IoT, etc.
- ROS 2's integration with DDS simplifies network programming, enhances scalability, and aligns well with ROS concepts like topics and publishers/subscribers.

**4. Understanding DDS Concepts:**

- **Domain:** Represents different subsystems or applications within a system. In ROS 2, the domain corresponds to the ROS ecosystem.
- **Topic:** A group of similar data streams within a domain. In ROS 2, topics serve the same purpose as in ROS 1.
- **Instance:** Represents individual data entities within a topic. In ROS 2, instances are akin to messages exchanged between processes.
- **Sample:** A snapshot of an instance at a particular time. In ROS 2, samples are individual messages transmitted between processes.

**5. Advantages of DDS for ROS 2:**

- Simplifies network programming and aligns well with ROS concepts.
- Provides inherent support for publisher-subscriber patterns.
- Facilitates discovery of nodes within the ROS ecosystem.
- Defines message serialization for efficient data exchange between processes.
- Offers flexibility in choosing DDS implementations from different vendors.

**6. Practical Implementation Steps:**

- **Installation:** Install ROS 2 on your preferred platform following the official installation instructions provided by the ROS community.
- **Migration Guide:** Refer to the ROS 1 to ROS 2 migration guide for a smooth transition of your existing ROS projects.
- **Code Refactoring:** Update your ROS 1 codebase to comply with ROS 2 standards and replace ROS-specific communication with DDS-based communication.
- **Testing and Debugging:** Test your ROS 2 applications thoroughly, debug any issues, and optimize performance as needed.
- **Community Support:** Engage with the ROS community, participate in forums, and seek assistance from experts to address any challenges encountered during the transition.
